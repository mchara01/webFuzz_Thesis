examples of concurrency in this article run only on a single CPU or core in your computer. The reasons for this have to do with the current design of CPython and something called the Global Interpreter Lock, or GIL. SAY ABOUT aimultiprocessing... Hold out on adding concurrency until you have a known performance issue and then determine which type of concurrency you need. As Donald Knuth has said, “Premature optimization is the root of all evil (or at least most of it) in programming.”
Parallelism consists of performing multiple operations at the same time. Multiprocessing is a means to effect parallelism, and it entails spreading tasks over a computer’s central processing units (CPUs, or cores).
