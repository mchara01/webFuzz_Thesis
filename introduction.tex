A highly automated testing technique that covers numerous boundary cases
using invalid data (from files, network protocols, API calls, and other targets)
as application input to better ensure the absence of exploitable vulnerabilities.
The name comes from modem applications’ tendency to fail due
to random input caused by line noise on fuzzy telephone lines.A highly automated testing technique that covers numerous boundary cases
