Once upon a time~\cite{cfi-attack}.

The Art of Computer Programming (sometimes known by its initials TAOCP) is a
comprehensive monograph written by Donald Knuth that covers many kinds of
programming algorithms and their analysis.

Knuth began the project, originally conceived as a single book with twelve
chapters, in 1962. The first three volumes of what was then expected to be a
seven-volume set were published in 1968, 1969, and 1973. The first published
installment of Volume 4 appeared in paperback as Fascicle 2 in 2005. The
hardback Volume 4A, combining Volume 4, Fascicles 0-4, was published in 2011.
Volume 4, Fascicle 6 ("Satisfiability") was released in December 2015, to be
followed by Volume 4, Fascicle 5 ("Mathematical Preliminaries Redux;
Backtracking; Dancing Links") in October 2018. Fascicles 5 and 6 are expected
to comprise the first two thirds of Volume 4B.
