\section*{\LARGE{Abstract}}
Testing software is a common practice for exposing unknown
vulnerabilities in security-critical programs that can be 
exploited with malicious intent. A bug-hunting method that has
proven to be very effective is a technique called fuzzing. Specifically,
this type of software testing has been in the form of fuzzing of native
code, which includes subjecting the program to enormous amounts of
unexpected or malformed inputs in an automated fashion. This is done
to get a view of their overall robustness to detect and fix critical
bugs or possible security loopholes. For instance, a program crash 
when processing a given input may be a signal for memory-corruption 
vulnerability or an SQL injection.

Although fuzzing significantly evolved in analysing native code, web
applications, invariably, have received limited attention, so far. This thesis 
explores the technique of grey box fuzzing of web applications and the 
construction of a fuzzing tool that will automate the process of discovering
bugs in web applications.

We design, implement and evaluate webFuzz, which is the first gray-box
fuzzer for web applications. webFuzz leverages instrumentation for 
successfully detecting reflective Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities
faster than other black-box fuzzers. The functionality of webFuzz is 
demonstrated using WordPress and Drupal.
