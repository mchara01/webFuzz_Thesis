I would like to express sincere gratitude to my Thesis Supervising Professor Dr. Elias Athanasopoulos for his crucial guidance, encouragement, support and advice he provided to help me complete and accomplish this dissertation. During the past year, Dr. Athanasopoulos' interest, enthusiasm and expert knowledge in the field of Cybersecurity has undoubtedly been a source of inspiration to me. He sparked my interest in computer security which has led to this thesis. All his positive input made this endeavour an exciting experience. 

Also, I would like to thank my fellow students Demetris Kaizer and Orpheas Van Rooy for their excellent teamwork and participation in a greater project that combines each of our thesis.

Furthermore, I would like to thank PhD. candidate Michalis Papapevripides of SREC Lab for his timely response to any issues that arose and for the assistance he provided me in resolving them.

Moreover, I want to thank all my professors from whom I received invaluable knowledge enabling me to become a Computer Scientist after my four years of study at the Department of Computer Science of the University of Cyprus.

Finally, I would like to thank my family and friends for being with me during my trials and tribulations, supporting me at every step of the way.
