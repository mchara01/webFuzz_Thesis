In this section we provide background information, to give a
detailed understanding about this thesis. First,we briefly discuss
what fuzzing is and the various categories that constitute
it. Then, we define what a Cross-Site scripting bug is in web
applications, and elaborate on an example regarding this
vulnerability.

\section{Fuzzing}
Software testing is a promising technique for discovering
unknown vulnerabilities in programs. In particular, software
testing has been realized in the form of fuzzing of native code,
where software is exercised using a vast amount of inputs
for inferring if any of them introduces security-related side
effects. A fuzzer can be categorized in relation to
its awareness of the program structure as black-, white-, or
grey-box.
